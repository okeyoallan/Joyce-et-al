## Physical preparation
   Hiking isn’t just a stroll in your local park – but requires strength and stamina, so it’s important you must put in the correct training beforehand!

* #### Start Your Training Early
    Make sure you create a training schedule at least 12 weeks before your hiking challenge. This will help you to stay on track and monitor your progress in the lead up to your big adventure! It’s never too early to start training for a hiking challenge – in fact, the earlier the better.


* #### Cardiovascular activities
    To build up your stamina, make sure you get some cardio into your training plan!
    * Running
    * Swimming
    * walking
    **this will help you prepare for long days in your hiking boots.**

    >Raising your heart rate by doing regular cardiovascular activities a couple of times a week will improve your overall fitness and make your mountain hiking experience a lot more enjoyable!


* #### Strength Training
    Build up your strength by regularly taking part in resistance training a couple of times a week. Concentrate on increasing the strength in your legs, glutes and core muscles. Exercises such as calf raises, squats and lunges are a fantastic way of preparing your muscles for a mountain hike.
